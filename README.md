derivative of zero-mean gaussian is highest at sigma and lowest at 0/extreme values

more common would be lp|p=(1/2, etc)
derivative of 0 is discontinuous

sigma
- too small -> coefficients outside window of strong gradient -> no downward pressure
- too large -> basically same thing
- dynamically augment sigma value based on parameter vector variance
- mess with (sigma > p)

- uncentered "second moment"
- distribution of vector components

related works
- related techniques to sparsify models
- importance of energy-efficiency

research question
- we'll focus on sparsifying regularization
  - compare baseline/control/standard regularization methods
- advantages with different attributes

future directions
- compare to overhead pruning

commutativity
l0 norm is NOT technically a norm

properties of norms: preserving linearity
